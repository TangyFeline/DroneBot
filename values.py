DRONE_INTRO_MESSAGE =f"""
Please try to keep with the dronification theme! This usually involves:
    o Replacing pronouns with 'it' and 'its'.
    o Replacing the person's name with a drone designation. Here's a random one if you don't have one in mind: %.
    o Replacing interests with suitably drone-like activities, such as servitude or beeping.

Copy paste the above intro, edit it to your liking, then send it as a message in this DM. Have fun!
